# Tencent invitation-beta deployment

This directory is the isolated deployment path for `ssh tencent` only. It does
not reuse or modify `webseit/deploy.sh`.

## Fixed beta topology

- Public endpoint: `https://82.156.152.27`
- ACME: Let's Encrypt `shortlived` profile, managed by Caddy 2.11.4
- ACME contact and product support: `guzilab@163.com`
- Account API: Caddy `/api/auth/*` -> `127.0.0.1:8478`
- Verification mail: account service -> `smtp.163.com:465` over implicit TLS
- AI gateway: Caddy strips `/ai` -> `127.0.0.1:8480`
- Read-only showcase: Caddy -> `127.0.0.1:8081`
- Future company site: `/srv/guzi-sites/company`, temporarily exposed at `/company/`
- Operating entity for the beta notices: 北京粟白科技有限公司
- Access logs: structured JSON on Caddy stdout, retained and rotated by journald

The filed `guzilab.com` domain can replace the IP site address later without
changing the internal service boundaries.

## Data and service boundaries

Account code is installed into an immutable release directory:

```text
/opt/guzi-scholar/releases/<release-id>/account/user_service.py
/opt/guzi-scholar/current -> /opt/guzi-scholar/releases/<release-id>
```

The account and AI services run as the non-login `guzi-account` user so both
can access the same SQLite database without weakening its permissions. State is
limited to `/var/lib/guzi-scholar/account` (`0700`), with `users.db` at `0600`.
The operator environment file is `/etc/guzi-scholar/account.env`, owned by root
at `0600`. It contains the SMTP authorization password and a separate secret
used to protect short-lived email codes. The AI credential file is
`/etc/guzi-scholar/ai.tokens.json`, owned by `root:guzi-account` at `0640`.
Real invite codes, SMTP credentials, email-code secrets, and provider tokens
must never be stored in this repository.

The first deployment migrates the existing database at
`/home/ubuntu/my-scholar-account/users.db`; later deployments automatically use
the canonical `/var/lib/guzi-scholar/account/users.db` and refuse to overwrite
it from the retired legacy path. The installer first creates a
consistent online snapshot, migrates a copy through schema version 6, verifies
SQLite integrity, email tables, and the user count, then stops the old account
service and repeats the backup and
migration against the final state. The live database is replaced only after all
checks pass.

## Deployment

The Tencent Cloud firewall must allow public TCP 80 and 443. The scripts do not
change Tencent Cloud console rules and do not enable UFW automatically.

Before preflight, provision the account environment and real AI profile JSON
through an approved out-of-band secret path. The account environment must keep
`MY_SCHOLAR_EMAIL_ENABLED=1` and `MY_SCHOLAR_REQUIRE_EMAIL_AUTH=1`, use `smtp.163.com:465` with
`MY_SCHOLAR_SMTP_SECURITY=ssl`, and set the SMTP authorization password and an
independent high-entropy `MY_SCHOLAR_EMAIL_CODE_SECRET`. Do not use the mailbox
login password or reuse either secret. A safe initial server-side state is
root-only; the transactional installer changes only the AI profile's group-read
bit for the service user:

```bash
ssh tencent 'sudo install -d -o root -g root -m 0700 /etc/guzi-scholar'
# Transfer from the approved secret source without printing its content.
ssh tencent 'sudo install -o root -g root -m 0600 \
  /path/to/staged-account.env /etc/guzi-scholar/account.env'
ssh tencent 'sudo install -o root -g root -m 0600 \
  /path/to/staged-ai.tokens.json /etc/guzi-scholar/ai.tokens.json'
```

`account.env.example` and `ai.tokens.example.json` document the schemas but
contain no usable secrets. Do not substitute either example during deployment.
The systemd unit requires `/etc/guzi-scholar/account.env` and runs the offline
`email-preflight` command before opening the database or starting the listener.
A disabled or incomplete email service, non-SSL transport, or mismatched sender
configuration therefore fails closed. The preflight does not connect to SMTP or send a message.

Run the read-only preflight first:

```bash
deploy/tencent/preflight.sh
```

After reviewing the dirty worktree and the release diff, deploy an intentional
beta build with an explicit version:

```bash
deploy/tencent/deploy.sh \
  --release-id 20260806-beta1 \
  --allow-dirty
```

`deploy.sh` refuses builds that do not expose the invitation-management
`create-invite` command. It never creates an invite automatically. After HTTPS
verification, inspect the deployed CLI and create a one-time invite explicitly:

```bash
ssh tencent 'sudo -u guzi-account /usr/bin/python3 -I -B \
  /opt/guzi-scholar/current/account/user_service.py create-invite --help'
```

Use the final syntax printed by the CLI. Treat the returned plaintext invite as
a secret and deliver it through a separate channel; only its hash belongs in
SQLite.

AI is a release requirement. `verify.sh` therefore requires
`guzi-scholar-ai.service`, a loopback listener on port 8480, and `GET /health`
through `/ai/health`. There is no release-mode bypass for an unconfigured AI
gateway because the beta promises the complete feature set.

## Backup and restore

`guzi-scholar-account-backup.timer` creates a SQLite online backup every day,
checks `quick_check`, `foreign_key_check`, and SHA-256, keeps at least 14
backups, and removes only backups older than 30 days beyond that minimum.
Backups are root-only under `/var/backups/guzi-scholar/account`.

Every deployment also creates a root-only transactional snapshot at:

```text
/var/backups/guzi-scholar/deployments/<release-id>
```

To restore one, provide the exact snapshot id. The command asks for the id a
second time before changing the server:

```bash
deploy/tencent/rollback.sh 20260806-beta1
```

Automatic rollback runs when the remote installer fails after the snapshot is
complete. A failed automatic rollback is reported prominently and retains the
snapshot for manual recovery.

## Known limits before public launch

- A six-day IP certificate relies on frequent automatic renewal. Caddy and NTP
  must stay healthy; certificate monitoring is still required.
- The 2 GB host is suitable for a low-volume SQLite invitation beta and static
  pages, not local model inference, bulk PDF processing, or high concurrency.
- The personal 163 mailbox is suitable only for low-volume transactional beta
  mail. Its documented daily allowance and anti-abuse decisions are dynamic,
  and successful SMTP acceptance does not guarantee inbox delivery. Keep
  application-level cooldowns, preserve the one-time recovery-code fallback,
  and move to a domain-based transactional mail service before public scale.
- Binding internal services to loopback prevents direct exposure, but cloud
  firewall policy must still be reviewed independently.
- Backups on the same host protect against database corruption and deployment
  mistakes, not total host loss. Add encrypted off-host backup before public
  registration.
- The reserved `/company/` path is not the final filed-domain company site and
  should not be promoted as such before ICP and legal-content review finish.
