# Guzi Scholar

Guzi Scholar is a local-first academic PDF reader for managing papers, structured reading, translation, annotations, notes, and article assistance in one desktop application.

The open-source desktop distribution targets macOS and Windows with one shared desktop codebase. The macOS package is available first; Windows packages will follow after real-machine verification.

## English documentation coming soon

The complete English README, installation guide, privacy notes, and contributor documentation are still being prepared. For now, please read the [Chinese README](README.md) and the platform notes in `apps/desktop/` and `platforms/windows/`.

The project code is licensed under [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). Third-party dependencies and bundled assets may have additional license and notice requirements.

## Downloads

Download the latest macOS Apple Silicon DMG from the [Releases](https://github.com/Chinese-Dragon-Li/Guzi-Scholar/releases) page. The current macOS package is an internal Preview: it uses ad-hoc signing and has not been signed with an Apple Developer ID or notarized by Apple. If Gatekeeper blocks the first launch, right-click `Guzi Scholar.app` in Finder, choose **Open**, and confirm the prompt. Updates are manual downloads from the Releases page; reliable in-app automatic replacement is not promised. Windows packages are coming after real-machine verification.

## Development

```sh
npm ci
npm --prefix apps/desktop ci
npm run desktop:dev
```

The shared desktop source lives in `apps/desktop/`. Platform packaging and launch configuration lives in `platforms/`. Please see [README.md](README.md) for the current feature list, requirements, data model, and contribution notes.
